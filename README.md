GWU Data Analytics Bootcamp - Module 1 Challenge
The Crowdfunding Excel file along with the Analysis word document constitute the first assignment of the GWU Data Analytics Bootcamp.
Topics of focus for this assignment included use of Excel charting, functions and visual analytics, as well as providing summary statistics.
I found the assignment incredibly effective in learning new Excel tools and tricks and an overall review in summary statitical analytics. BRAVO class!!!
